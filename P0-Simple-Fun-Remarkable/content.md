Before you start developing your game, you need to have a clear idea of what you're going to make. Though you must absolutely adapt your idea as you're developing it, especially in response to user feedback, you don't want to be charging in blind.

You need to keep in mind that you're not a big studio. You don't have a big budget, a large team, and lots of time. But you can still be competitive. We know it because we've seen it done time and time again. You are more creative than the folks at big studios and you understand your target market better. In fact you probably are your target market!

Above all else though, we want you to keep one thing in mind...

#Simple. Fun. Remarkable.

Fun. You can wrap your head around that. But why simple? Why remarkable?

Simplicity is important for two reasons. The first is that you risk not finishing your game if it is too complex. The best way to sell 0 copies of your game is to never release it!

The most spectacular failures of the game industry are not games that launched and flopped, but rather games that never launched at all. From Dragon Empires to Starcraft Ghost, there are plenty of examples of professionals even getting too ambitious and never finishing their games.

These represent hundreds of millions of dollars of development, all for nothing because the game was never released. Why? Over-scoping.

The easiest way to over-scope a game is to make it multiplayer, or even worse massively multiplayer. Avoid this for your first game. Please. We see so many first-time game designers try and make MMOs. The cancelled MMO graveyard is particularly vast, and the ones that are released tend not to do so well. 99.999% fail.

If this is your first game, you're likely to be 5-10X off on the amount of development time required!

The first game you make will take longer than expected. It will be sloppy. It will be an amazing learning experience. There are people in the game industry who have worked for years of their lives on games, and yet never had a single real player in the wild play their games because their games were never released. When you finish your game, you will join a special club in the game industry, that of the game developer who shipped their game. We know companies that raised millions of dollars and never shipped a single game. Millions.

The second reason your game should be simple is that players will give it less than a minute, sometimes less than 20 seconds, to decide whether they like your game. If your game take longer than that to appreciate, it will be ignored by the majority of players. Sad, but true.

So what does it mean to be remarkable?

A game is remarkable when, after you play it, you feel it is worth taking time out of your day to show it to someone else.

Keep in mind you can't be remarkable in all ways. If you try and make a remarkably gorgeous, remarkably realistic action-RPG-RTS with a remarkably deep story, a remarkably deep character creation and progression system, with remarkably many enemies, and remarkably satisfying gameplay... you're going to have a bad time.

Being remarkable is your key to success. Pick a way in which which you will be remarkable and excel at it.

#Remarkable Games

We want to expose you to a small collection of mobile games that are similar to the types of games or applications you may want to build, and to explore how they are remarkable. Not all of these will resonate with you - everyone's tastes differ - but we hope this will help you build a mental model of what is and isn't remarkable in mobile gaming. Even though you will be building a VR game or application, analysis of these games can help you design your own product.

- [Dots](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dots-a-game-about-connecting/id632285588?mt=8) is remarkably simple with delightful animations. The gameplay is remarkably pure and satisfying.

- [Dumb ways to die](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dumb-ways-to-die/id639930688?mt=8) is remarkably funny. The gameplay isn't quite as polished as in Dots, but it never ceases to make you laugh with its twisted humor.

- [4 Pics 1 Word](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/4-pics-1-word/id595558452?mt=8) is remarkably annoying. It lets you build up a winning streak only to stump you. You cannot help but feel like the answer is on the tip of your tongue, and to solve the puzzle you'll either pay money to get a hint or show a friend to get help. The developer either gets $$$ or your help spreading the game. Win-win.

- [Jetpack Joyride](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jetpack-joyride/id457446957?mt=8) is remarkably delightful. You don't start from a fixed position, you blast through a wall. The game is satisfying before it even starts. You trample loads of little scientists along your way - a hilarious and delightful touch. The powerups are varied, funny, and fun.

- [Tiny Wings](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-wings/id417817520?mt=8) is also remarkably polished. Every menu item you touch responds in a satisfying manner, visually and with sound. The bird is adorably animated. The gameplay is very simple, but the controls are remarkably fluid. It's so beautiful you want to show your friends.

- [SpaceTeam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spaceteam/id570510529?mt=8) is remarkably innovative. You play with friends, everyone is on the same team and has a control panel on it with knobs that say things like "Flux Capacitor" and "Newtonian Photomist" on them. You shout instructions that sound like they are out of a sci-fi B-movie at each other ("Engage the warp core!" and "Set the Iono-Prism to 3") and you must complete the instructions shouted at you on your control panel. Hilarious and very different from most games out there.

#Learn how to spot remarkable games

You should check out the top games and applications in Steam every day. In particular try and pick from the Indie section or ones that look like something you could build and download them.

Try and understand how they made it to the top. If you're already an avid  gamer you have a head start. If not you have to put yourself into the gaming mindset. Learn to spot and understand the simple, fun, and remarkable games and applications that you enjoy.

If what you're building is not different enough in some way, if you don't think people will take time out of their day to tell their friends about it, you're not maximizing your potential.

#Questions to ask yourself

When brainstorming, ask yourself:

- If you could change just one thing about the current leader in a game genre in order to make it more remarkable, what would that be?

- If you were going to make a parody or spoof of your game, what would it look like? This will give you a clue to what could be remarkable about your game.

- Remember that convenience is king – what could you do to make buying, using, and consuming easier?

- Remarkable games are often controversial and outrageous – what would a really controversial or outrageous version of your game look like?
